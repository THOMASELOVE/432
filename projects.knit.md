You will complete two projects in 432 this semester. 

- Each involves the submission (and approval) of a **proposal** well in advance of the final project deadline.
- All information on deadlines for projects will be found at the [Course Calendar](calendar.html).

## Project 1

1. Project 1 involves linear and logistic regression, is tightly formatted, and must use data that are already available to anyone on Earth. 

**Instructions for Project 1** are found at the [Project 1 Github page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project1)

## Project 2

2. Project 2 is much more flexible in terms of methods and can use data that cannot be shared with anyone, even Dr. Love. 

**Instructions for Project 2** are found at the [Project 2 Github page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project2)
