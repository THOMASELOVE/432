Prior to the start of the course, email Dr. Love at **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu** with any questions.

### Once the class starts, use Piazza to contact us

As in 431, we will be using [the Piazza software](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432) for asynchronous discussion about 432. Rather than emailing questions, I encourage you when possible to post your questions about labs, class sessions, or other matters to Piazza.

- The Piazza system is designed to get you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. 
- You'll need to sign up for the 432 class (if you took 431 this Fall, you should be able to connect directly using your old account.) Our class signup link is: https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432.
- Once you are logged in to Piazza, you will see a contribution link asking you to make a small financial contribution to Piazza to help Piazza maintain the service. Making a contribution is **NOT** required for you to use the service through the semester.

### Teaching Assistants and Office Hours

Dr. Love will be supported by eight outstanding teaching assistants - all of whom return from their work this Fall in 431. Most of the TAs are volunteering their time and energy to help you with the course, and they will be very eager to meet with you. Learn more about the TAs in [the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html). 

TA office hours begin on Thursday 2021-02-04 and continue through Monday 2021-05-10. Zoom information to join these sessions is posted to [Canvas](https::/canvas.case.edu) in the **Announcements** section and also in our shared Google Drive (be sure to log in to Google via CWRU to see the shared Drive.)

- Thursdays from 5:00 to 6:30 PM ET
- Fridays from 3:00 to 4:30 PM ET and from 6:00 to 7:30 PM ET
- Saturdays from 10:30 to 11:30 AM ET and from 3:00 to 4:30 PM ET
