Welcome! PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 432 is the second half (431 is the first half) of a two-semester course taught by Professor Thomas Love in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. Everything that Professor Love will provide to help you with the course will appear on this website.

The class will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 - 2:15 PM virtually, using the Zoom platform, starting on 2021-02-02. Information on the Zoom meetings will be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Everything You Need Will Be Here by February 1

The menu bar will expand to include links to everything you'll need this semester as they become available, including

- the course syllabus
- the [course calendar](calendar.html), which provides the final word on all deadlines, and also provides links to all materials used in each class session
- the course notes, written by Dr. Love specifically for this class, which will continue to update throuh the semester
- the course assignments, including two projects, two quizzes, and six labs.
    - All deadlines for these assignments appear in the [calendar](calendar.html).
- information on [installing R and RStudio](software_install.html), [installing key R packages](r_packages.html), and [downloading data](data_index.html) (and code) you'll need for the class.
- a link to the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) system (log-in required) we use to communicate information about Zoom sessions, and for turning in assignments
- places where you can [get help and contact us](contact.html).

## What Must I Purchase for this Course?

1. You will need easy access to a computer where you can download R, R Studio, the data we'll use and where you can regularly install and update R Packages. [Details on software are here](software_install.html).
2. You will also need a copy of Nate Silver's book **The Signal and the Noise**, available [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087) for about $20. 
    - The 2015 edition is sufficient for 432, and either an electronic or paper version is fine. In 2020, Nate added a new preface, which is interesting, but not critical.
3. Jeff Leek's **How to be a Modern Scientist** available as an ebook [on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) for a suggested $10.
    - This short book was written in 2016, and is thus a little out of date, but still very helpful. You can read the entire book in a couple of hours.

Deadlines for reading chapters in Silver and sections in Leek are posted in the [calendar](calendar.html).

## Key Topics for 432 in Spring 2021

For some sense of how the course will flow, visit the [calendar](calendar.html)

1. Dealing with interaction and other forms of non-linearity in regression models by spending degrees of freedom on non-linear terms.
2. Using regression methods for different purposes (exploring associations, making predictions, assessing cause and effect)
3. Logistic regression and generalized linear models for binary, count and multi-categorical outcomes
4. Using tidymodels approaches to build models in a more automated, tidier way, and to use alternative approaches for fitting including robust and Bayesian regressions.
5. Variable selection and its woeful performance in real situations.
6. Why statistical significance and p values are problematic.
7. Retrospective assessments and issues related to power and sample size
8. Dealing with survival data, with an introduction to censoring, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models
9. Using sampling weights to mirror populations in modeling results (NHANES being a prime example)
10. Dealing with hierarchical data, with an introduction to repeated measures
11. Doing replicable research, and how to be a modern scientist with a web presence
